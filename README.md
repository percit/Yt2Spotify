To make it work:
- go through "GettingAPIs.md" to enable everything
- install Go (I used Go 20)


- Basically, ignore the HTML/CSS for now. Convert it into a console application that will use a switch statement and numbers
- to choose a song and an additional number to indicate whether to add it or not. Finally, it will display the names of the songs
- that were not selected, allowing for easy cleaning.
- There are also nice libraries for console applications that will render everything nicely.
